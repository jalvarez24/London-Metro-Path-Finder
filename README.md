# London-Metro-Path-Finder (Fall 2016)
Unfinished Project for Data Structures Course. Uses DFS (Depth-First Search) to find a valid path between two London Metro stations.

# What does the code do?
Takes in two text files:
  -1: Names of all stations (string) and corresponding stations number (int)
  -2: All connections between stations (int to int)

Creates a 2D matrix to demonstrate all connections between matrix. Will use DFS to search through these connections until/if one is found and returns first one.
